# Family Rules

Rules of The Realm

The checklist must be done before any shows or screens.

+ **Clothes put away** - Clothes need to be off floor. Jackets hung up. 
Dirty clothes in the hamper. Backpacks either hung up, or packed and ready to go somewhere.
No clothes are ever on the floor. Hats, belts, other accessories, all 
put away.
+ **Beds made** - if you aren't actively sleeping, your bed is to be made.
+ **Homework done** - if you've been assigned homework, it's done. 
If you have a math test, do it. If you've got pages to do, do them.
+ **Toilets flushed** - Every bowl is a fresh bowl. No excuses. There's never 
an empty toilet paper roll. No one uses the Parent's bathroom.
+ **Kitchen put away** - Cabinets closed. No glasses on counter. Fridge closed. 
No food left out. Trash gets put out if it goes over the top of can or bag is full.
+ **Meals** - You take your won plates and one of the parent's. Scrape the food and all plates and 
utensils are place in the left sink. No parent does dishes except for cookware. 
Person that does the cooking does not have to do more than their plate and a parent's (if child cooks).
+ **Cars** - Cars will be left empty. Much as with the bed, if you aren't actively in the car driving,
the car will be empty of your stuff and your stuff will be put away. No food, no shoes, no papers, 
no pencils, no garbage. The car will be entered and left clean.

**If any of these are not done at any time, everything stops. All shows,
all internet, everything. This is a minimum bar.**
